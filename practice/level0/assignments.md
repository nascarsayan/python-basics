1. What does the range() function do? What will be the number of iterations in the following loops?

    1.
    ```py
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
    ```

    2.
    ```py
    for i in range(0, 10):
        print(i)
    ```

    3.
    ```py
    for i in range(1, 10, 3):
        print(i)
    ```

    4.
    ```py
    for i in range(10, 1, -1):
        print(i)
    ```

2. Write a loop to ask a number N from user. Print all even numbers between 1 and N (including N).
    Input: 10
    Output: 2 4 6 8 10

3. Write a loop to ask a number N from user. Print all odd numbers between 1 and N (including N).
    Input: 10
    Output: 1 3 5 7 9

4. Write a loop to ask a number N from user. Print all numbers between 1 and N (including N) which are divisible by 2 or 5.
    Input: 10
    Output: 2 4 5 6 8 10

5. Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum.

6. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with "Hello, [name]!".

7. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. The program should ask the user for the length and width of the rectangle and then print the area.

8. Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd. The program should take the number as input from the user and print whether it is even or odd.

9. Write a program that calculates the area of a circle. The program should ask the user for the radius of the circle and then print the calculated area.

10. Write a program that swaps the values of two variables. Ask the user for two numbers and swap their values.

11. Write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Ask the user for the temperature in Celsius and print the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit.

12. Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not. Ask the user for a year and print whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year which is divisible by 4 but not by 100. If a year is divisible by 4 and by 100, it is a leap year only if it is also divisible by 400.

13. Write a program that generates the multiplication table of a given number. Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table up to 10.
Example:
Input: 5
Output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50

14. Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

15. Write a program that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest among them. Print the largest number.
